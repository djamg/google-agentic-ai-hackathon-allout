## 🚀 **Enhancements Made**

### **2. Enhanced Welcome Experience**

**Before:**
```
👋 Welcome to Bangalore Buzz! I'm here to help...
```

**After:**
```

🚀 Quick Start:
• 💬 Chat with me - Ask questions like "What can you help with?"

```

### **5. Better Error Handling**

Enhanced response handling for edge cases:
```javascript
} else if (result.agent_type === 'general') {
    // Fallback for general responses
    addMessage('assistant', result.response || '💬 I received your message! How else can I help you?');
}
```

```python
prompt = f"""

### **Frontend Changes (templates/index.html)**
```javascript
// New function for conversation starters
function sendSuggestion(text) {
    document.getElementById('message-input').value = text;
    sendMessage();
}
```

```html
<!-- Interactive suggestion buttons -->
<button onclick="sendSuggestion('Hello! What can you help me with?')" 
        style="background: #e3f2fd; color: #1976d2; ...">
